What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
What is the difference between fetch and pull?

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Pairing in a GPS was really fun and helpful. I really enjoyed working together with one another and also having someone to
look over us. Working with someone helped me think more and ask questions. Having a guide was also super helpful. The guide
made sure we were on track and to point out stuff we did wrong or was not sure of.
